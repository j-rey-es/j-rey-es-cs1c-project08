    The first graph shows that there is a drop in runtime early on in the recursion limits tested. This effect is only seen
in smaller array sizes (>2000000). With larger array sizes the increase in recursion limit does not have the same effect.
There is an increase in runtime after the initial drop.
    In the zoomed graph we can see that the drop in runtime occurs around 4 recursion limit for arrays with sizes less
than 2M. After 4 recursion limit, the runtime begins to level out and slightly increase.
